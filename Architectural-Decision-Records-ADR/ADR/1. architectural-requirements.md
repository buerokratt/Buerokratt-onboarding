# ARCH-001: General Architectural Requirements

## Context

To support **scalability, flexibility, and maintainability**, the DMR architecture must be fully modular. Each core function — including message routing, validation, observability, and policy control — must operate as an **isolated service**. All communication between components must occur via **well-defined HTTP APIs**, allowing for independent development, deployment, and replacement of services.

This modularity ensures:
- Clear boundaries between responsibilities
- Seamless upgrades and scaling
- Minimized risk of cascading failure or tight coupling
- Compatibility with Nginx, which acts as the core of DMR routing and enforcement

---

## Decision

### 1. Modular Functional Boundaries

- All major responsibilities must be implemented as **independent services**, including:
  - DMR node proxy and relay
  - Policy distribution (CentOps)
  - Certificate and key lifecycle handling
  - Monitoring and metrics aggregation
- Services must be **functionally decoupled** and must not share internal state or libraries

### 2. HTTP-Only API Integration

- All inter-service communication must occur over **HTTP REST APIs**
- No use of:
  - gRPC
  - WebSockets
  - Message buses (e.g. Kafka, NATS) for control-plane traffic

- API endpoints must:
  - Be clearly versioned (e.g. `/api/v1/`)
  - Return structured responses and error formats
  - Be documented and discoverable internally

### 3. Replaceability and Isolation

- Any component may be replaced independently as long as it adheres to its API contract
  - Example: a logging exporter may be swapped without modifying DMR node logic
- Business logic must remain encapsulated within its respective service
- External configuration must define behavior, not hardcoded logic

### 4. Nginx Compatibility Constraint

- All services integrated with DMR must:
  - Accept requests and emit responses in a format routable and inspectable by **Nginx-based DMR nodes**
  - Avoid protocol features not supported by Nginx (e.g., HTTP/2-specific framing, raw socket streams)
- Headers and metadata required for validation or routing must be compatible with Nginx header handling

### 5. Environment and Deployment Separation

- Each functional service must run in a **separate container or Kubernetes pod**
- Runtime environments must enforce:
  - Role-specific permissions
  - Minimal and auditable inter-service access
  - Independent scaling policies

## Example

### REST API for Policy Retrieval (DMR to CentOps)

```http
GET /api/v1/policy/active
Host: centops.internal
Authorization: Bearer <dmr-node-token>
Accept: application/json
```

### Kubernetes Deployment Separation

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dmr-router
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: dmr-router
          image: ghcr.io/org/dmr-router:v1.5.1

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: centops-service
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: centops
          image: ghcr.io/org/centops:v0.9.5
```

---

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**

- **Modular and Maintainable** – Each component evolves independently without ripple effects
- **Infrastructure Alignment** – All services are fully compatible with Nginx routing and enforcement
- **Simplified Debugging** – HTTP-based interfaces allow for transparent inspection, logging, and testing

### **Potential Trade-offs**

- **Interface Discipline Required** – APIs must be stable, versioned, and consistently documented
- **Overhead for Simple Tasks** – Breaking down logic into services introduces some complexity in orchestration
- **HTTP Constraint** – Advanced streaming or stateful protocols are not supported
