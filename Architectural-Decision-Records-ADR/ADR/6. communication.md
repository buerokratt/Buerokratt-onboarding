# COMM-001: Communication Protocol & Message Structure

## Context

The DMR (Distributed Message Rooms) network requires a communication model that enforces **transport-level confidentiality**, **metadata-level authorization**, and **consistent structure** for secure, distributed message exchange. DMR nodes must remain fully blind to message content while still being able to validate sender identity, enforce access controls, and forward messages between authorized participants.

To support scalability, decentralization, and zero trust design, the protocol must guarantee separation between metadata and payload, and provide deterministic validation logic that does not rely on application-specific behavior.

---

## Decision

### 1. Transport Requirements

- All communication must occur over **mutually authenticated encrypted channels**.
- Connections must use **mTLS** with a shared, verifiable root of trust.
- Transport protocols must support:
  - Bidirectional, persistent sessions
  - Header-level inspection by intermediate DMRs
  - End-to-end encryption of the payload

### 2. Message Structure Principles

- Every message must consist of two distinct layers:
  - **Metadata layer**:
    - Carries structured, signed, and verifiable information required for routing and authorization
    - Accessible to DMRs
  - **Payload layer**:
    - Fully opaque and encrypted
    - Ignored by DMRs

- No routing, policy, or authorization logic may depend on or inspect the payload.

### 3. Validation Rules

- DMRs must enforce deterministic validation logic based on metadata only.
- Required metadata must:
  - Be explicitly structured (e.g., in headers or envelope format)
  - Be cryptographically signed or tokenized
  - Contain expiration and scope indicators
- Messages must be **rejected** if any of the following are true:
  - Metadata is missing required fields
  - Metadata fails cryptographic verification
  - Metadata is expired or outside scope
  - Metadata is duplicated or malformed

### 4. Protocol Extensibility

- The protocol must support:
  - Versioning of metadata schema and transport framing
  - Backward-compatible extensions through namespaced fields
  - Explicit treatment of required vs optional metadata

- The system must **not rely** on any implicit behavior such as path parsing, payload introspection, or side-channel metadata (e.g., IP or TLS fingerprinting).

## Example

### Message Envelope Concept (Transport-Neutral Format)

```text
[ Transport Layer: mTLS over HTTP/2, HTTP/3, or QUIC ]

→ METADATA (verifiable, structured, DMR-accessible)
→ PAYLOAD (opaque, encrypted, ignored by DMRs)
```

### Metadata Validation Policy (Conceptual Configuration)

```yaml
dmr_validation_policy:
  transport_security: mtls
  metadata:
    signed: true
    required_fields:
      - sender_id
      - recipient_id
      - authorization_token
      - message_id
      - timestamp
    reject_if_unsigned: true
    reject_if_expired: true
    fail_on_missing_fields: true
  payload:
    allow_access: false
    allow_routing_logic: false
```

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**

- **Strict Separation of Concerns** – DMRs operate on verifiable metadata without accessing content.
- **Secure-by-Design** – Protocol enforces encrypted transport and metadata validation.
- **Standardized Message Structure** – Enables uniform DMR behavior across implementations.

### **Potential Trade-offs**

- **Increased Complexity for Clients** – Clients must handle encryption, token signing, and metadata construction correctly.
- **Higher Validation Overhead** – Metadata validation introduces computational cost at DMR nodes.
- **Rigid Message Requirements** – Any deviation from structure or signature validity results in rejection without fallback.
