# MEMB-001: Dynamic Node Membership

## Context

The DMR (Distributed Message Rooms) network must support dynamic participation from both:

- **DMR nodes**, which form the distributed validation and routing mesh
- **Participants**, which send and receive messages using DMRs as secure proxies

Both categories must be able to **join or leave the system at any time**, while ensuring that all interactions remain **authorized, observable, and governed**. Unauthorized actors — whether internal or external — must be excluded automatically based on centrally distributed policies.

The system relies on **CentOps (Central Operations)** to manage and distribute trusted membership state across the network. CentOps will act as the **source of truth** for which nodes and participants are authorized, what roles they hold, and how other DMRs should interpret their presence.

---

## Decision

### 1. CentOps as Source of Truth

CentOps is responsible for:

- Registering and tracking both **DMR nodes** and **data participants**
- Assigning **roles**, **scopes**, and **permissions**
- Distributing **signed membership manifests** to the DMR network
- Propagating **join**, **leave**, **revocation**, and **status change** events

DMRs must validate all peer and participant metadata against CentOps-signed state, either directly or via secure relays.

### 2. DMR Node Membership

- A DMR node is considered a valid network participant only if:
  - It appears in the latest signed CentOps registry
  - It is not marked as evicted, revoked, or unknown
- Nodes must update their local view of the network periodically or via push updates

DMRs must **ignore or reject connections** from unknown or outdated peer nodes.

### 3. Participant Membership

- Participants (e.g. clients, services) must be registered with CentOps before using the DMR network
- Each participant record must include:
  - A globally unique ID
  - Assigned scopes (e.g. can send to group X, can read from service Y)
  - Cryptographic keys or signing authorities used for token issuance

DMRs must use participant metadata to validate authorization tokens attached to messages.

## Example

### CentOps Membership Registry Snapshot

```yaml
centops:
  dmr_nodes:
    - id: dmr-node-03
      status: active
      roles: ["router", "validator"]
    - id: dmr-node-12
      status: revoked

  participants:
    - id: client-17
      status: active
      allowed_recipients: ["service-42"]
      allowed_scopes: ["submit"]
    - id: service-42
      status: active
      allowed_senders: ["client-17"]
```

### Join Event (DMR Node)

```json
{
  "type": "dmr_join",
  "node_id": "dmr-node-03",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-27T18:20:00Z",
  "roles": ["validator", "router"],
  "signature": "MEQCIBUcbR0..."
}
```

### Participant Registration Update (Distributed via CentOps)

```json
{
  "type": "participant_update",
  "participant_id": "client-17",
  "status": "active",
  "scopes": ["submit"],
  "allowed_recipients": ["service-42"],
  "issued_at": "2025-03-27T17:00:00Z",
  "signature": "MGUCIQDvKt3..."
}
```

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**

- **Unified Governance** – All actors in the system (DMRs and participants) are governed by a single source of authority.
- **Policy-Driven Membership** – Roles, scopes, and relationships are explicitly modeled and verifiable.
- **Security and Flexibility** – New nodes or clients can join or be removed without redeploying the network.

### **Potential Trade-offs**

- **CentOps Dependency** – All join/leave logic depends on timely and correct behavior from CentOps.
- **Update Lag** – Delayed propagation of revocations may lead to temporary access by stale participants.
- **Dual Lifecycle Complexity** – Managing DMR node state and participant permissions introduces two layers of operational complexity.
