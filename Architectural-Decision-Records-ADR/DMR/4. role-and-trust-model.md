# TRUST-001: Role & Trust Model

## Context

To enable secure, distributed message handling between systems and users, the DMR (Distributed Message Rooms) network must enforce **strict trust boundaries** and **zero content visibility**. DMR nodes act as **validation and routing intermediaries**, ensuring only authorized parties can exchange messages. These nodes must remain unaware of the actual message content and operate solely on metadata.

The architecture must support **dynamic node participation**, where DMRs can join or leave the network at any time, without compromising the integrity, trust, or security of the system.

---

## Decision

### 1. Metadata-Only Operation

- DMRs must never access, parse, decrypt, or store message content.
- Message routing and access validation must be based solely on headers and metadata.

### 2. Authorization via Signed Headers

- Each message must include verifiable metadata:
  - `X-Sender-ID` – unique client identifier
  - `X-Recipient-ID` – intended receiver
  - `X-Authz-Token` – signed token asserting identity and permissions
- Tokens must be:
  - Signed by a trusted authority
  - Time-limited and scoped
  - Structured for easy validation

### 3. Mutual Authentication via mTLS

- All communication between clients and DMRs, and between DMRs themselves, must use **mutual TLS (mTLS)**.
- All certificates must chain to a **shared root of trust**.
- Certificate rotation must follow centralized policy distribution mechanisms (e.g., CentOps).

### 4. Fail-Closed Trust Boundary

- DMRs must strictly reject any message that fails validation.
- No retries or fallbacks should be attempted at the DMR layer.

---

## Example

### Use (Metadata-Only Message with Signed Headers)

```http
POST /relay HTTP/1.1
Host: dmr-node-1.example.org
X-Sender-ID: client-xyz
X-Recipient-ID: service-abc
X-Authz-Token: eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

(Content-Length: 0 or encrypted body ignored by DMR)
```

### Forbidden (Accessing or Parsing Message Payload)

```bash
cat message.json | jq '.payload'
```

---

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**

- **Zero Trust Alignment** – DMRs remain blind to sensitive content, enforcing strict boundary enforcement.
- **High Scalability** – Stateless validation on metadata makes scaling horizontally trivial.
- **Auditable Auth Flows** – Every message must be cryptographically verifiable.

### **Potential Trade-offs**

- **Metadata Design Overhead** – Requires careful planning of what metadata is needed and how it's structured.
- **Operational Key Management** – Public key distribution and token validation must be managed centrally and securely.
- **Strict Failure Mode** – Messages that fail validation are dropped immediately with no recovery path inside the DMR network.

# TRUST-002: Authorization & Identity Validation Mechanism

## Context

In the DMR (Distributed Message Rooms) network, each node must act as a gatekeeper that enforces **strict identity verification and authorization checks** before allowing message propagation. The system operates in a zero-trust model where neither clients nor other DMRs are inherently trusted.

To ensure messages are exchanged only between authorized participants, identity claims must be cryptographically verifiable, and permissions must be scoped and time-bound. The authorization model must support dynamic participants, revocable access, and fine-grained policy enforcement without requiring access to message payloads.

---

## Decision

### 1. Identity Assertion Mechanism

- Each request must include an identity assertion that:
  - Is cryptographically signed by a trusted authority
  - Includes:
    - Unique sender identity
    - Target recipient identity
    - Expiry timestamp
    - Optional scope or usage claims
- Identity assertions must be transportable and verifiable by any DMR node without shared secrets.

### 2. Signature Verification

- DMRs must validate the authenticity and integrity of each identity assertion by:
  - Verifying digital signatures using a trusted public key
  - Rejecting any assertion with an invalid signature, tampered payload, or expired timestamp

- Public keys must be:
  - Distributed via a central authority or trusted configuration mechanism
  - Rotatable without disrupting service

### 3. Authorization Model

- Authorization decisions must be based on validated metadata only, using:
  - Policy rules that define allowed sender/recipient pairs, scopes, or group affiliations
  - Optional revocation lists or deny rules to override valid signatures

- DMRs must operate in **fail-closed** mode:
  - If authorization cannot be conclusively verified, the message must be rejected
  - No fallback or "best-effort" delivery is allowed

### 4. Stateless Validation

- DMRs must not store long-lived session or trust state
- All authorization checks must be performed per message using self-contained metadata or tokenized headers

---

## Example

### Identity Token (Compact Format)

```json
{
  "sender": "client-789",
  "recipient": "service-xyz",
  "exp": "2025-03-28T00:00:00Z",
  "scope": ["submit", "read"],
  "signature": "MEUCIQDxR2VZaCJz..."
}
```

### Authorization Policy (Conceptual Rule Definition)

```yaml
authorization_policy:
  trusted_issuers:
    - authority.dmr.example
  allow:
    - sender: client-789
      recipient: service-xyz
      scopes: ["submit"]
  deny:
    - sender: client-789
      recipient: service-blacklisted
```

---

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**

- **Strong Security Guarantees** – All access is validated using cryptographic proofs.
- **Interoperable Authorization** – No shared secrets required; public key verification ensures consistency.
- **Stateless Verification** – No persistent session state is required at DMR nodes.

### **Potential Trade-offs**

- **Token Lifecycle Management** – Requires robust issuance, expiration, and revocation handling.
- **Public Key Distribution Overhead** – Secure and reliable delivery of public keys is essential for correctness.
- **Strict Rejection Policy** – Any error in the signature, format, or trust chain results in message loss.
