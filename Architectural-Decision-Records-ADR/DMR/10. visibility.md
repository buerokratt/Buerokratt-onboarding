# VIS-001: Monitoring and Observability

## Context

DMRs operate as **security-enforcing message relays** with strict trust boundaries. To ensure operational integrity and performance, each DMR must expose **transparent, privacy-preserving telemetry** that enables:

- Real-time health monitoring
- Policy violation auditing
- Load analysis and routing diagnostics

Since DMRs are built on Nginx, observability must rely on **non-invasive logging, metrics, and optional trace events**. Observability data must never include message payloads or sensitive identifiers beyond authorized metadata.

---

## Decision

### 1. Metrics Exposure via Nginx + Sidecar

- Each DMR must expose a **metrics endpoint** (e.g. Prometheus-compatible) including:
  - Request counts and rates
  - Authorization failure counts
  - Routing targets and success/failure stats
  - Config reload status and errors
- This may be implemented via:
  - Native Nginx stub status module (basic)
  - Exporters or Lua plugins (extended)
  - Sidecars that observe and transform logs into metrics

### 2. Logging Requirements

- DMRs must emit structured logs for each request, including:
  - Timestamp
  - Sender ID (if verifiable)
  - Recipient ID (if specified)
  - Result (forwarded, rejected, invalid)
  - Reason for rejection (if applicable)

- Logs must be:
  - JSON-formatted for parsing and indexing
  - Streamed to CentOps or an external log collector
  - Stripped of any message body or sensitive context

### 3. Configuration Change Tracking

- Every applied configuration change (policy, routing, peer topology) must:
  - Be logged with version and source
  - Include outcome (success, rejected)
  - Include a digital signature if distributed via CentOps

- Failed config reloads must trigger alerts and retain the last valid state

### 4. Optional Trace and Debug Events

- DMRs may emit **anonymized trace events** for debugging distributed message paths, such as:
  - Request ID
  - Hop sequence (DMR IDs)
  - Processing duration per hop
- These must be opt-in and scoped per tenant or debug context

## Example

### Prometheus Metrics Output

```text
dmr_requests_total{result="forwarded"} 15830
dmr_requests_total{result="rejected",reason="auth_failed"} 321
dmr_upstream_failures_total{target="dmr-node-12"} 12
dmr_config_reload_status{status="success"} 1
```

### Structured Log Event

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-03-27T20:10:00Z",
  "sender": "client-17",
  "recipient": "service-42",
  "result": "rejected",
  "reason": "token_expired",
  "request_id": "msg-842394"
}
```

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**

- **Operational Visibility** – Teams gain insight into traffic, failures, and config health without violating trust boundaries.
- **Auditable Behavior** – All message handling paths are traceable through structured logs and metrics.
- **Performance Tuning** – Load distribution and node performance can be adjusted based on real telemetry.

### **Potential Trade-offs**

- **Volume of Logs and Metrics** – High-frequency relays may generate significant telemetry data.
- **Privacy Risk from Misconfiguration** – Incorrect logging could leak metadata if not explicitly filtered.
- **External Dependencies** – Observability may rely on external collectors, which must be secured and monitored.
