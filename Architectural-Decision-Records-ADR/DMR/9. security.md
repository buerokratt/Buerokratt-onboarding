# SEC-001: Certificate Lifecycle Management

## Context

All communication within the DMR network — including participant-to-DMR and DMR-to-DMR — must occur over **mutually authenticated TLS (mTLS)** connections. The trust model is rooted in certificate-based authentication, requiring DMRs to correctly manage the full lifecycle of:

- Certificates issued to DMR nodes and participants
- Trust anchors and root CAs
- Validation procedures and revocation mechanisms

Certificates are central to **trust enforcement**, **routing eligibility**, and **metadata verification integrity**, and must be maintained without human intervention to support dynamic membership and scalable mesh operation.

---

## Decision

### 1. Certificate Roles and Scope

- Every DMR node must be provisioned with a unique **mTLS certificate**, scoped to:
  - Node identity (e.g. `dmr-node-03`)
  - Valid usage for TLS server and client auth
  - Limited lifetime (e.g. 30–90 days)
- Participants must also hold mTLS certificates or use signed tokens linked to a verifiable identity certificate

- Certificates may optionally include:
  - Role claims (e.g. `router`, `validator`)
  - Organizational metadata (e.g. environment: prod/stage)

### 2. Trust Anchors and Validation

- Each DMR must maintain a **trusted root certificate store**, which:
  - Includes one or more root CAs authorized by CentOps
  - Supports certificate path validation at runtime
  - May be updated dynamically via signed CentOps payloads

- Certificate validation must occur during:
  - TLS handshake (for all inbound and outbound connections)
  - Token verification (for identity claims referencing cert fingerprints)

### 3. Rotation and Renewal

- Certificate renewal must be **automated**, with no manual re-enrollment:
  - DMRs must support pre-expiry rotation windows
  - Certificate renewal may occur via:
    - CentOps-integrated issuance flow
    - External service like SPIFFE, Vault, or cert-manager

- DMRs must automatically reload new certificates without requiring restarts

### 4. Revocation and Expiry Handling

- DMRs must reject:
  - Expired certificates
  - Certificates explicitly marked as revoked in a CRL or CentOps-issued denylist
- On encountering a revoked peer:
  - The DMR must remove the node or participant from its active routing view
  - Log and optionally emit an alert regarding trust breach

---

## Example

### Certificate Validation Configuration (Conceptual)

```yaml
dmr_certificates:
  trust_roots:
    - /etc/dmr/trust/ca.pem
  auto_reload: true
  rotation_threshold_days: 10
  crl_sources:
    - https://centops.example.org/crl/latest.pem
```

### Sample Certificate Metadata (Participant)

```yaml
subject: client-17
valid_from: 2025-03-01T00:00:00Z
valid_to: 2025-05-30T00:00:00Z
fingerprint: 8A:D3:42:...
roles: [submit]
issuer: centops-root-ca
```

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**

- **Strong Identity Validation** – mTLS ensures mutual trust across all connections in the mesh.
- **Automated Lifecycle Management** – Reduces operational overhead and renewal failure risks.
- **Immediate Revocation Reaction** – DMRs enforce trust boundaries without needing full reboots or network-wide restarts.

### **Potential Trade-offs**

- **Operational Complexity** – Integration with external CAs or issuance services adds initial setup complexity.
- **Revocation Timing Risk** – CRL-based revocation may introduce short-term exposure without real-time propagation.
- **Reload Sensitivity** – Misconfigured or malformed certificate updates can interrupt communication if not validated properly.
