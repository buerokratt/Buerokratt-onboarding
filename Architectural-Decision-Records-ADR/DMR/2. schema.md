# SCHEMA-001: Schema Versioning

## Context

DMRs rely on structured metadata to enforce trust, route messages, and apply policies. This includes:

- Participant identity and authorization tokens
- Routing metadata (e.g. scopes, rooms, namespaces)
- Configuration payloads from CentOps (e.g. policies, peer lists)

To ensure **forward and backward compatibility**, DMRs must adhere to a **versioned schema model**. Schemas must be **strictly validated**, and schema changes must be **explicit, auditable, and non-breaking** unless coordinated across the mesh.

---

## Decision

### 1. Schema Versioning Rules

- Every schema used by DMR (e.g. message headers, config files, policy bundles) must:
  - Include an explicit `version` field
  - Use a **semantic versioning** pattern (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`)
  - Treat MAJOR changes as **breaking**; MINOR and PATCH as **compatible**

- DMRs must:
  - Accept only known and supported schema versions
  - Gracefully reject or ignore unknown or unsupported versions
  - Retain backward-compatible logic when operating in mixed-version environments

### 2. Schema Validation Strategy

- All incoming structured metadata must be validated against:
  - A defined schema for the declared version
  - Expected required fields, types, and constraints

- Schema validation must occur:
  - On message ingress (for headers and tokens)
  - On configuration load (for policy/config files from CentOps)

- Invalid or unrecognized schemas must cause hard rejection with a structured error

### 3. Controlled Schema Evolution

- New schema versions must be introduced using:
  - CentOps distribution of validation logic and format definitions
  - Dual-version support windows to allow progressive adoption
  - Validation libraries embedded within each DMR to support multiple active schemas

- Deprecated versions must be:
  - Announced centrally (e.g. via signed CentOps notice)
  - Logged when encountered
  - Eventually rejected after a defined phase-out window

### 4. Format Agnosticism

- Schemas may use multiple serialization formats (e.g. JSON, YAML, CBOR) but must:
  - Clearly declare their format and version
  - Include deterministic field naming and value encoding rules

## Example

### Metadata Envelope (Versioned)

```json
{
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "sender": "client-17",
  "recipient": "service-42",
  "scope": "submit",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-27T21:00:00Z",
  "authz_token": "eyJhbGciOi..."
}
```

### Configuration Bundle (Schema Version Declared)

```yaml
version: "2.0.0"
issued_by: centops
routing:
  - from: client-17
    to: service-42
    scopes: ["submit"]
signature: "MEYCIQ..."
```

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**

- **Interoperability** – Versioned schemas allow for phased upgrades and mixed-version operation.
- **Validation Consistency** – DMRs enforce schema structure uniformly across message flows and configurations.
- **Safe Evolution** – New formats or metadata structures can be introduced without disrupting the network.

### **Potential Trade-offs**

- **Increased Implementation Complexity** – DMRs must support multiple schema versions and validation logic.
- **Coordination Overhead** – Breaking schema changes require coordinated rollout across DMRs and CentOps.
- **Upgrade Lag Risk** – Participants or nodes running older schema versions may fail silently or be rejected during transitions.
