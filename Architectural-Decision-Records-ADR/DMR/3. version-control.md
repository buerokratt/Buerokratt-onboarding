# VC-001: Version Control Strategy

## Context

To ensure **consistency, traceability, and reproducibility** across all development and deployment workflows, a structured version control strategy must be enforced. This enables:

- Auditable changes to code, configuration, and policies  
- Safe promotion of features across environments  
- Predictable rollback in the case of failure  
- Efficient collaboration across teams and pipelines

The DMR project uses **GitHub** for source and config management, with **Docker** for containerization and **Kubernetes** for deployment orchestration.

---

## Decision

### 1. GitHub Repository Structure and Access

- All DMR code, policy templates, schema definitions, and deployment manifests must be versioned in **GitHub repositories**
- Repository access must be restricted based on environment:
  - `main` – production deployment state
  - `stage` – pre-production (staging environment)
  - `test` – integration test pipeline
  - `dev` – active feature development

- All changes must flow via pull requests (PRs) and require:
  - Review by a designated team
  - Status checks (lint, build, schema validation) before merge
  - CI/CD pipeline integration to validate and publish artifacts

### 2. Branching and Promotion Workflow

- Changes follow a top-down promotion path:

  ```text
  dev → test → stage → main
  ```

- Features are developed in `dev`, tested and validated in `test`, staged for release in `stage`, and promoted to production in `main`
- Environment-specific values (e.g. secrets, namespace overrides) must be separated from core manifests

### 3. Docker Image Versioning

- Each DMR component must be built as a Docker image with:
  - A tag corresponding to Git commit SHA or release tag
  - An immutable image hash stored in deployment manifests

- Docker images must be pushed to a private registry, e.g.:

  ```yaml
  image: ghcr.io/org/dmr:v1.2.0
  ```

- Image tags must be embedded into Kubernetes deployment templates and policy manifests distributed via CentOps

### 4. Kubernetes Deployment Metadata

- All Kubernetes manifests must include:
  - A reference to the deployed version or Git tag
  - A unique config hash or signature for tracking policy versions

- Manifests must be managed via:
  - Separate overlays per environment (e.g. using Kustomize or Helm)

---

## Example

### Docker Build & Tag (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - run: docker build -t ghcr.io/org/dmr-proxy:${{ github.sha }} .
      - run: docker push ghcr.io/org/dmr-proxy:${{ github.sha }}
```

### Kubernetes Deployment Annotation

```yaml
metadata:
  name: dmr-proxy
  annotations:
    dmr/version: v1.2.0
    dmr/config-sha: 7c3e2a1f
```

---

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**

- **Structured Environment Control** – GitHub branching directly maps to deployment stages
- **Immutable Artifacts** – Docker and Git ensure traceability of what was deployed, when, and by whom
- **Kubernetes-Aware Versioning** – Metadata embedded into manifests supports rollback, audit, and cross-team diagnostics

### **Potential Trade-offs**

- **Strict Promotion Process** – Requires discipline to maintain environment boundaries and version metadata
- **CI/CD Pipeline Complexity** – Docker builds, image management, and deployment pipelines must be tightly coordinated
- **Rollback Planning** – Backward compatibility of config and policy updates must be ensured between versions
