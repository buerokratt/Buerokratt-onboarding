# ROLES-001: Participant-to-Participant Messaging via DMR

## Context

The primary purpose of DMR is to **relay secure, policy-compliant messages between authorized participants**, using DMR nodes as metadata-validating proxies. Each message originates from **Participant A** (the sender) and is intended for **Participant B** (the recipient). DMRs must enforce all trust, authorization, and routing logic based solely on message metadata, and must never access or depend on message payloads.

This ADR defines the **end-to-end communication path**, including metadata responsibilities, enforcement points, and DMR-specific behaviors to ensure **confidentiality, integrity, and strict policy compliance** during transmission.

## Decision

### 1. Metadata Responsibility of Participants

- **Participant A** must:
  - Construct a message envelope with:
    - A signed identity and authorization token
    - Declared recipient identity
    - Optional routing context (e.g. room, scope)
  - Encrypt the payload using **Participant B’s public key** (end-to-end encryption)
  - Submit the message to a trusted DMR entry point over **mTLS**

- **Participant B** is responsible for:
  - Accepting messages only from trusted DMR egress nodes
  - Verifying sender identity and token validity (optional double verification)
  - Decrypting the payload using their private key

### 2. DMR Behavior in the Messaging Flow

Each DMR involved in transit must:

- Validate metadata (sender, recipient, scope) against current policy
- Confirm signature on the authorization token
- Route the message toward an eligible next hop (based on DMR routing logic)
- **Never inspect, decrypt, or persist the payload**
- Emit logs or metrics only based on metadata (e.g. sender, recipient, scope, result)

DMRs must drop the message immediately if:

- Metadata is missing, malformed, expired, or unverifiable
- Routing is disallowed per current policy
- The recipient is not reachable within the trusted DMR mesh

### 3. Hop-to-Hop Delivery Guarantees

- Each DMR must ensure:
  - Message delivery to the next trusted hop (with mTLS)
  - Proper rejection handling on failure (e.g. 403, 404, timeout)
  - No caching or buffering of messages beyond forwarding

- DMRs are not responsible for:
  - Guaranteed delivery (this is an application-level concern)
  - Acknowledgement semantics between A and B
  - Message order or duplication handling

---

## Example

### Metadata Sent by Participant A (via mTLS to DMR)

```http
POST /relay HTTP/1.1
Host: dmr-entry.example.net
X-Sender-ID: client-17
X-Recipient-ID: service-42
X-Authz-Token: eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIs...
X-Scope: submit
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Content-Length: 2048

[binary payload encrypted for service-42]
```

### DMR Forwarding Log Event

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-03-27T20:30:00Z",
  "sender": "client-17",
  "recipient": "service-42",
  "result": "forwarded",
  "hop": "dmr-node-07",
  "request_id": "msg-473922"
}
```

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**

- **End-to-End Privacy** – DMRs relay messages without ever accessing the encrypted payload.
- **Policy-Based Control** – Message delivery is constrained to allowed sender/recipient pairs.
- **Composable Path** – Multiple DMRs can participate in routing while preserving statelessness and security.

### **Potential Trade-offs**

- **No Guaranteed Delivery** – Failures at any hop result in message drop unless application-layer retries are implemented.
- **Metadata Trust Complexity** – Both sender and recipient must trust the metadata and enforcement done by DMRs.
- **Token Verification Burden** – Every message requires signature validation at the DMR layer.
