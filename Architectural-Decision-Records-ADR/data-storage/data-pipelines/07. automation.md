# AUTO-001: Workflow Automation & Orchestration

## Context

To ensure **efficient and reliable execution of NLP processing workflows**, the architecture must support **automated task scheduling, orchestration, and retry mechanisms**. Automation ensures **scalability, consistency, and error handling** across text extraction, transformation, and indexing pipelines.

## Decision

1. **Automated Workflow Execution**
   - The system must support **task scheduling, dependency management, and failure handling**.
   - Workflow orchestration must be **distinct from data ingestion**.
   - Example orchestration frameworks include **Apache Airflow, Prefect, or Dagster**.
   - Example data ingestion frameworks include **Apache NiFi**, which handles data movement before orchestration.
   - Workflows must be **defined as code** to ensure version control and reproducibility.

2. **Support for Scheduled and Event-Driven Tasks**
   - NLP tasks such as **crawling, text extraction, and indexing** must support **time-based scheduling and event-driven execution**.
   - The system must allow **trigger-based workflows** based on external events (e.g., new data availability).

3. **Retry and Resumption Mechanisms**
   - Failed tasks must be **automatically retried** based on pre-configured policies.
   - Workflows must support **checkpointing** to resume from the last successful state.
   - Logs must track **failure causes, retries, and recoverability status**.

4. **Scalability and Distributed Execution**
   - Workflow execution must be **horizontally scalable** to handle increased processing loads.
   - Distributed execution must be **supported via worker nodes or cloud-based execution environments**.

# AUTO-002: Event-Driven Processing for NLP Tasks

## Context

To enable **real-time text ingestion and processing**, NLP workflows must support **event-driven triggers**. This ensures that workflows respond dynamically to **incoming data changes**, reducing latency in text analysis pipelines.

## Decision

1. **Event-Based Triggers**
   - The system must support **event-driven execution** for NLP workflows.

2. **Dynamic Workflow Invocation**
   - Workflows must automatically start when **new text data arrives from web scrapers, APIs, or document stores**.
   - Processing must include **deduplication mechanisms** to prevent duplicate execution.

3. **Real-Time Processing Pipelines**
   - NLP pipelines must be optimized for **low-latency execution** when triggered by streaming data sources.
   - Example: **Processing new articles as they are scraped, rather than in scheduled batches**.

## Example

### Use (Event-Driven Workflow Triggered by New Data in a Message Queue)
```json
{
  "event": "new_document_received",
  "document_id": "xyz789",
  "source": "https://example.com/new-article",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T14:10:00Z"
}
```

### Forbidden (Polling for New Data Instead of Event-Based Processing)
```bash
while true; do
  check_new_documents.sh
  sleep 60
done
```

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**
- **Reduced Latency** – Processes text data as soon as it is available.
- **Efficiency** – Avoids unnecessary polling and reduces processing overhead.
- **Scalability** – Supports high-throughput ingestion with minimal resource waste.

### **Potential Trade-offs**
- **Complex Event Handling** – Requires robust error handling and deduplication.
- **Infrastructure Dependence** – Requires event-driven services and queue management.
