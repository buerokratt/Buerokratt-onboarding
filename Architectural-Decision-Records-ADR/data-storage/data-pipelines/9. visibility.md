# VIS-001: Alerts & Notifications

## Context

To ensure **proactive issue detection, real-time observability, and operational insights**, the system must implement **centralized alerting mechanisms**. These enable quick incident response, performance tracking, and seamless debugging across NLP workflows.

## Decision

1. **Failure Alerts & Notification Channels**

   - Workflow failures must trigger **automated alerts** via multiple channels:
     - **Email notifications** for critical failures.
     - **Signal and/or Microsoft Teams alerts** for engineering teams.
     - **Integration with monitoring tools** (e.g., Prometheus Alertmanager, PagerDuty, Opsgenie).
   - Alerts must contain **detailed error context, affected components, and suggested resolution steps**.

2. **Configurable Severity Levels**

   - Alerts must be categorized into severity levels:
     - **Critical** – Immediate action required, system failure.
     - **Warning** – Performance degradation, partial failures.
     - **Informational** – Status updates, non-disruptive events.
   - Different severity levels must have **customized alerting rules**.

3. **Integration with Monitoring Tools**

   - Alerts must be **tightly coupled with monitoring dashboards**.
   - Example integration:
     - A workflow failure is logged in **OpenSearch** → triggers an alert in **Grafana** → sends a **Signal** notification.
   - Alert events must be **queryable for auditing and debugging purposes**.

## Example

### Use (Structured Alert Event Format)

```json
{
  "alert_id": "alert-12345",
  "severity": "critical",
  "workflow": "nlp_text_processing",
  "task": "extract_entities",
  "status": "failed",
  "error": "Timeout while connecting to NER model",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T14:15:00Z",
  "notified_channels": ["email", "Signal"],
  "suggested_resolution": "Check network connectivity and retry the API call."
}
```

### Forbidden (Unstructured Alert with No Context)

```bash
echo "System failed" | mail -s "Error" admin@example.com
```

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**

- **Proactive Issue Resolution** – Immediate alerts reduce downtime and failure impact.
- **Efficient Incident Management** – Categorized alerts prevent unnecessary escalations.
- **Standardized Alerts** – Ensures structured alerts integrate seamlessly with monitoring mechanisms.

### **Potential Trade-offs**

- **Notification Fatigue** – Too many alerts may overwhelm teams.
- **Infrastructure Overhead** – Requires integration with multiple alerting tools and monitoring systems.
- **Complexity in Rule Tuning** – Needs well-defined alerting rules to avoid false positives.

# VIS-002: Real-Time Monitoring & Dashboards

## Context

To enable **real-time observability** in NLP workflows, the system must provide **comprehensive monitoring and visualization tools**. Dashboards must offer **operational insights, failure tracking, and performance analysis**.

## Decision

1. **Compatibility with NLP-Specific Monitoring Tools**

   - The system must support integration with **text-focused monitoring tools** such as **LangChain logs, MLflow, or OpenTelemetry**.

2. **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboards**

   - The system must provide **real-time dashboards** for workflow execution visibility.
   - Example solutions: **Grafana, Kibana, or cloud-native monitoring tools**.
   - Dashboards should display **task execution status, processing time, and failure trends**.

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**

- **Operational Insights** – Enables real-time monitoring of text processing workflows.
- **Faster Debugging** – Dashboards allow quick visualization of failure points.
- **Proactive Issue Resolution** – Alerts notify teams before failures escalate.

### **Potential Trade-offs**

- **Monitoring Complexity** – Requires dashboard setup and maintenance.
- **Resource Costs** – Real-time tracking tools may require additional computational resources.

# VIS-003: Incident Management & Automated Remediation

## Context

To ensure **system resilience and reduced downtime**, the system must support **automated remediation mechanisms** that respond to failures before human intervention is required. Self-healing processes ensure that NLP pipelines remain operational even in degraded conditions.

## Decision

1. **Self-Healing & Automated Resolution Actions**

   - The system must support **automated remediation actions** based on alert types.
   - Example:
     - If an NLP pipeline fails due to an API timeout, **automatically retry the request before escalating the alert**.
     - If resource limits are exceeded, **scale the affected service automatically**.

2. **Automated Workflow Recovery**

   - NLP workflows must include **automatic retries with exponential backoff**.
   - If a process repeatedly fails, **a fallback mechanism must be triggered** (e.g., switching to an alternative NLP model, temporarily reducing workload).

3. **Incident Tracking & Resolution Logging**

   - Each failure event must be **logged with root cause analysis (RCA) details**.
   - Resolved incidents must be marked with **resolution actions** for future analysis.

## Example

### Use (Automated Remediation Example in Workflow Execution)

```json
{
  "incident_id": "inc-56789",
  "workflow": "nlp_text_processing",
  "task": "extract_entities",
  "status": "auto-recovered",
  "resolution": "Increased API request timeout from 5s to 10s",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T14:20:00Z"
}
```

### Forbidden (Manual Recovery Without System Logs)

```bash
systemctl restart nlp_pipeline
```

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**

- **Reduced Downtime** – Automated recovery reduces the need for human intervention.
- **Efficient Incident Response** – Incident tracking provides insights for long-term system improvements.
- **Increased Resilience** – NLP pipelines adapt dynamically to failures.

### **Potential Trade-offs**

- **Complex Automation Logic** – Requires tuning retry policies and failover mechanisms.
- **Risk of Over-Reliance** – Automated actions must be carefully tested to prevent unintended consequences.
