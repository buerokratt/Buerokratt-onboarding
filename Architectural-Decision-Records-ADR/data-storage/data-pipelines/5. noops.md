# NOOPS-001: Cloud & Hybrid Deployment Strategy

## Context

To ensure **scalability, flexibility, and interoperability**, NLP processing must support **multi-cloud and hybrid deployments**. The system should allow NLP workflows to run seamlessly across **AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premises environments**, providing deployment flexibility and resilience.

## Decision

1. **Multi-Cloud & On-Prem Support**
   - NLP workloads must be **deployable on multiple cloud providers** (AWS, Azure, GCP) and on-premises infrastructure.
   - Cloud-agnostic containerization (e.g., **Docker, Kubernetes**) must be used to ensure deployment consistency.
   - Workflows should allow **dynamic switching between cloud and on-prem resources** based on availability and cost.

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**
- **Flexibility** – Avoids cloud vendor lock-in, allowing dynamic workload distribution.
- **Scalability** – Enables NLP processing across diverse infrastructures.
- **Cost Optimization** – Supports cost-effective resource utilization based on availability.

### **Potential Trade-offs**
- **Operational Complexity** – Requires multi-cloud orchestration and monitoring.
- **Security & Compliance Challenges** – Different cloud providers may have varying security policies.

# NOOPS-002: Containerization & Orchestration

## Context

To maintain **scalability, modularity, and deployment consistency**, NLP workloads must be **containerized and orchestrated** in a cloud-agnostic manner.

## Decision

1. **Containerization Standards**
   - All NLP workloads must be **containerized using Docker**.
   - NLP services should be **modularized into independent, replaceable microservices**.

2. **Orchestration Framework**
   - **Kubernetes (K8s)** must be used for orchestration to ensure scalability and high availability.
   - The deployment must support **auto-scaling, load balancing, and self-healing mechanisms**.

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**
- **Portability** – Consistent deployments across cloud and on-prem environments.
- **Scalability** – Enables workload distribution across multiple nodes.
- **Fault Tolerance** – Ensures resilient NLP processing via auto-recovery features.

### **Potential Trade-offs**
- **Deployment Overhead** – Kubernetes management adds operational complexity.
- **Resource Costs** – Running Kubernetes clusters requires additional infrastructure resources.

# NOOPS-003: Secure Hybrid Processing

## Context

To ensure **data security in hybrid NLP processing**, all interactions between **on-premise and cloud components** must be encrypted and authenticated.

## Decision

1. **Secure Communication**
   - Secure data transfer mechanisms (e.g., **VPN, private links, encrypted API gateways**) must be enforced.
   - NLP pipelines must use **end-to-end encryption** for data in transit.

2. **Access Control & Authentication**
   - **Strict IAM policies** must be enforced for all cloud and on-prem resources.
   - APIs must use **OAuth, JWT, or mutual TLS authentication**.

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**
- **Data Protection** – Prevents unauthorized access and data leaks.
- **Regulatory Compliance** – Aligns with industry security standards.
- **Secure Workflows** – Ensures safe hybrid processing across environments.

### **Potential Trade-offs**
- **Performance Overhead** – Encryption and secure tunnels may increase processing latency.
- **Complex Access Management** – Requires maintaining IAM policies across hybrid environments.

# NOOPS-004: Auto-Scaling & Fault Tolerance

## Context

To support **scalable NLP workloads**, the system must automatically scale resources based on demand while ensuring resilience against failures.

## Decision

1. **Dynamic Resource Scaling**
   - Workloads must **auto-scale based on CPU, memory, and request volume**.
   - Must support **horizontal scaling (adding more instances) and vertical scaling (adjusting instance size dynamically)**.

2. **Failure Recovery & Resilience**
   - Services must have **built-in retry mechanisms with exponential backoff**.
   - Load balancing and failover strategies must be in place to **reroute traffic during failures**.

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**
- **Improved System Availability** – Auto-scaling ensures continuous NLP processing.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization** – Allocates computing power only when needed.
- **Minimized Downtime** – Fault tolerance prevents complete service failure.

### **Potential Trade-offs**
- **Scaling Delays** – New instances may take time to initialize, causing temporary slowdowns.
- **Resource Costs** – Over-scaling may lead to unnecessary cloud expenses.
