# FORMAT-001: Processing Allowed File Formats

## Context

To ensure **flexibility and maintainability**, the system must support a **configurable list of allowed file formats**. This allows seamless processing of different text-based inputs (structured and unstructured) while ensuring integration with external tools.

Each allowed file format must have a **linked REST API endpoint** responsible for handling its ingestion and processing.

## Decision

1. **Configurable File Format List**
   - The system must maintain an **editable list** of supported file formats.
   - Formats should be **grouped by processing type** (structured vs. unstructured).

2. **Linked REST Endpoints for Processing**
   - Each file format must be linked to a **specific API endpoint** that handles its ingestion and transformation.
   - The endpoint must provide **format validation, extraction, and conversion capabilities**.

3. **Versioning and Compatibility**
   - The format list must be **versioned** to track changes in allowed formats.
   - New formats must be **backward-compatible** with existing workflows.

## Example

### Use (Configurable File Format List with REST Endpoints)
```yaml
allowed_formats:
  structured:
    - format: "csv"
      mime_type: "text/csv"
      processing_endpoint: "/api/process/csv"
    - format: "json"
      mime_type: "application/json"
      processing_endpoint: "/api/process/json"
  unstructured:
    - format: "txt"
      mime_type: "text/plain"
      processing_endpoint: "/api/process/txt"
    - format: "html"
      mime_type: "text/html"
      processing_endpoint: "/api/process/html"
    - format: "pdf"
      mime_type: "application/pdf"
      processing_endpoint: "/api/process/pdf"
```

### Forbidden (Hardcoded or Untracked Formats)
```yaml
allowed_formats:
  - "csv"
  - "json"
  - "txt"
```

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**
- **Flexible Configuration** – New formats can be added without modifying core logic.
- **Interoperability** – External systems can query and process based on format type.
- **Centralized Management** – Ensures all formats and processing methods are **tracked and versioned**.

### **Potential Trade-offs**
- **Increased Complexity** – Managing dynamic configuration requires additional validation.
- **Dependency on API Stability** – Changes to endpoints require proper versioning.

# FORMAT-002: Encoding

## Context

To ensure **maximum compatibility** and **standardization**, **UTF-8 must be the default encoding** for all text data outputs. However, some external tools or legacy systems may require different encodings. Therefore, the encoding format must be **configurable via configuration files**.

This approach allows **seamless integration** with both modern and older systems while maintaining **interoperability and flexibility**.

## Decision

1. **UTF-8 as Default Encoding**
   - All text-based outputs **must default to UTF-8**.
   - UTF-8 ensures **broad support for multilingual content** and **minimizes encoding errors**.

2. **Configurable Encoding via Configuration Files**
   - The encoding format **must be configurable** in a central settings file.
   - Supported encodings should include **UTF-16, ASCII, ISO-8859-1, etc.**.

3. **Validation & Enforcement**
   - Encoding configuration must be **validated during system startup** to prevent unsupported formats.
   - Logs must record any **non-default encoding selections** for traceability.

## Example

### Use (Configurable Encoding in YAML)
```yaml
encoding_settings:
  default_encoding: "UTF-8"  # System-wide default
  allowed_encodings:
    - "UTF-8"
    - "UTF-16"
    - "ASCII"
    - "ISO-8859-1"
```

### Forbidden (Hardcoded Encoding Without Configuration)
```yaml
encoding: "ISO-8859-1"
```

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**
- **Standardization** – Ensures UTF-8 is the default, reducing encoding-related errors.
- **Configurable Flexibility** – Allows adaptation to legacy systems when needed.
- **Error Reduction** – Prevents issues from incorrect encoding formats in text outputs.

### **Potential Trade-offs**
- **Validation Overhead** – Additional checks are needed to enforce encoding policies.
- **Complexity in Legacy Systems** – Some legacy encodings may not fully support modern characters.
