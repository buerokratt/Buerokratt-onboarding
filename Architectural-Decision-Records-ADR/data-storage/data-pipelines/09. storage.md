# STORAGE-001: Storage Requirements for Text Data

## Context

Text data storage should be optimized for **text search, retrieval speed, and scalability**, guiding the selection of appropriate storage solutions based on well-defined criteria.

## Decision

1. **Primary Storage Model**
   - Data should be stored using a **document-oriented approach** for structured text.
   - The storage system must support **full-text search, indexing, and efficient retrieval**.
   - Example: **OpenSearch** as a reference implementation for document-oriented storage.

2. **Blob Storage for Large Text Files**
   - Large text files (e.g., PDFs, HTML documents, raw text dumps) must be stored in **object storage**.
   - The object storage must support **S3-compatible APIs** for portability and scalability.
   - Example: **AWS S3 or MinIO** as reference implementations.

3. **Strict Separation of Storage Types**
   - **Metadata and structured text** must reside in the document store.
   - **Raw, unstructured files** must be stored in object storage, with references in the document store.

4. **Standardized Access Layer**
   - A unified **storage abstraction layer** should be implemented for all read/write operations.
   - APIs should expose methods for **searching, indexing, and retrieving** text data.
   - The system must ensure **interchangeability** without modifying upstream applications.

5. **Scalability & Redundancy**
   - The storage system must support **horizontal scaling** to handle increasing text data.
   - Redundancy mechanisms must be in place to **prevent data loss** and ensure high availability.

## Example

### Use (Storing Text Data in a Document Store with Blob Storage Reference)
```json
{
  "document_id": "abc123",
  "source": "https://example.com/article",
  "language": "en",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T14:00:00Z",
  "content": "Sample text content...",
  "metadata": {
    "indexed": true,
    "storage_backend": "opensearch",
    "blob_reference": "s3://bucket-name/path/to/file.pdf"
  }
}
```

### Forbidden (Storing Large Text Data Directly in a Relational Database)
```sql
INSERT INTO text_data (id, content) VALUES (1, 'Large text content that should be stored in blob storage');
```

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**
- **Enforced Consistency** – Clearly separates structured and unstructured text storage.
- **Optimized Performance** – Ensures fast retrieval via indexing and document-based search.
- **Scalability** – Storage scales with increasing data volume while maintaining performance.

### **Potential Trade-offs**
- **Reduced Flexibility** – Requires strict adherence to predefined storage models.
- **Implementation Overhead** – Enforcing a unified access layer adds initial development complexity.
