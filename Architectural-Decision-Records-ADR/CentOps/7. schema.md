# SCHEMA-001: Standard Interfaces for Telemetry Inputs and Outputs

## Context

Telemetry data flows through multiple parts of CentOps: from local agents to the central aggregator, and from the aggregator to dashboards, alerting systems, or APIs. To ensure these flows remain stable, extensible, and compliant, CentOps must define and enforce a **clear schema** for telemetry inputs and outputs.

This schema is not about how telemetry is collected or transported — those concerns are addressed elsewhere — but rather about the **structure and validation of the data itself**, regardless of origin or destination.

## Decision

- All telemetry inputs and outputs must conform to a **versioned, structured schema**.
- The schema must define:
  - required fields for context and value
  - optional fields for non-sensitive enrichment
  - prohibited fields that must never appear
- Inputs that do not pass schema validation must be rejected.
- Output interfaces must expose structured, queryable telemetry in a predictable format (e.g., JSON over HTTPS).
- Schema versions must be explicitly declared and backward-compatible where possible.

## Example

```yaml
telemetry_interface:
  input_schema_version: v1
  required_fields:
    - environment_id
    - component
    - metric_type
    - value
    - timestamp
  optional_fields:
    - region
    - deployment_id
    - alert_flag
  prohibited_fields:
    - log_content
    - user_id
    - trace_payloads

  output:
    format: json
    endpoint: https://telemetry.centops.io/query
    supported_queries:
      - metrics_by_component
      - error_rate_over_time
      - uptime_by_environment
```

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes**
- Enables robust validation and data quality control for telemetry pipelines.
- Supports consistent integration with downstream consumers such as dashboards and alerting systems.
- Simplifies version management and schema evolution.

**Trade-offs**
- Adds rigidity to telemetry integrations, requiring adherence to a fixed schema.
- Increases maintenance effort when schema changes are needed.
- May limit expressiveness for use cases that fall outside the defined structure.
