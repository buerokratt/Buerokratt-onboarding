# VC-001: Version Control Strategy

## Context

To ensure **consistency, traceability, and reproducibility** across all CentOps components and workflows, a strict version control strategy must be enforced. This is essential for:

- Auditable changes to CentOps code, pipeline logic, telemetry schemas, and deployment definitions  
- Controlled promotion of features across client environments  
- Predictable rollback when failures occur  
- Consistent collaboration across teams and automated pipelines

CentOps uses **GitHub** for managing all source code, configuration, and pipeline definitions. **Docker** is used for packaging, and **Kubernetes** for deploying CentOps services and agents across environments. GitHub Actions powers all automation.

## Decision

### 1. GitHub Repository Structure and Access

- All CentOps code, telemetry schema definitions, pipeline templates, and Kubernetes manifests must be versioned in **GitHub repositories**
- Repository structure must reflect the promotion path:
  - `main` – production-ready state
  - `stage` – pre-production staging
  - `test` – automated integration test workflows
  - `dev` – active development and experimentation

- All changes must be introduced via **pull requests (PRs)**, with:
  - At least one code review from an authorized maintainer
  - Automated checks for linting, build integrity, and schema validation
  - Pipeline integration to build and publish Docker images on merge

### 2. Branching and Promotion Workflow

- CentOps uses a **top-down promotion model**:

  ```text
  dev → test → stage → main
  ```

- All pipeline logic, deployment templates, and schema definitions must follow this flow
- Environment-specific secrets or overrides must be externalized from core manifests

### 3. Docker Image Versioning

- All CentOps components must be containerized, with images built and tagged by GitHub Actions:
  - Tags must use Git commit SHA or release tag for traceability
  - Immutable image hashes must be embedded in deployment manifests

- Images must be pushed to a private registry such as:

  ```yaml
  image: ghcr.io/org/centops-telemetry:v2.1.3
  ```

- Tags used for production must be promoted only via controlled merges to `main`

### 4. Kubernetes Deployment Metadata

- All Kubernetes manifests must include:
  - The deployed component version (tag or Git SHA)
  - A config signature or hash to track exact state

- Deployment manifests must be maintained using:
  - Overlays or templates (e.g. Kustomize or Helm) per environment

## Example

### Docker Build & Tag (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - run: docker build -t ghcr.io/org/centops-agent:${{ github.sha }} .
      - run: docker push ghcr.io/org/centops-agent:${{ github.sha }}
```
````

### Kubernetes Deployment Annotation

````markdown
```yaml
metadata:
  name: centops-agent
  annotations:
    centops/version: v2.1.3
    centops/config-sha: 9a1f2be7
```

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes**
- Enforces clear mapping between Git branches and deployment stages
- Provides full traceability of artifacts, pipelines, and production deployments
- Embeds version metadata directly into runtime environments for observability and rollback

**Trade-offs**
- Requires rigorous PR and tagging discipline to preserve promotion integrity
- Increases dependency between Git workflows and deployment automation
- Adds operational complexity for managing config version compatibility across branches
