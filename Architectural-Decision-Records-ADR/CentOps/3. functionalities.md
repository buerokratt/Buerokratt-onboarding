# FUNC-001: Client Update Notification and Execution Workflow

## Context

CentOps must be able to reliably distribute updates (e.g. new versions of telemetry agents, policy templates, or delivery logic) to client environments. However, due to client isolation and security boundaries, updates cannot be force-pushed or automatically installed without local validation and control.

To balance operational control and client autonomy, updates must follow a **three-phase workflow**:
1. **CentOps notifies** the client that updates are available.
2. **Client requests** an update manifest from CentOps.
3. **Client validates and installs** the updates using its local update controller.

This approach ensures that updates are initiated locally, validated transparently, and installed safely without violating data boundaries or requiring direct remote execution.

## Decision

- CentOps must support a **notification system** to inform each client environment that updates are available.
- Clients must **poll or receive** notifications from CentOps using a secure, authenticated channel.
- Once notified, the client sends a **fetch request** to retrieve a structured **update manifest**.
- The update manifest includes:
  - The version of each component to be updated
  - The source location of update packages (e.g. container image, script URL)
  - Validation metadata (e.g. hash, signature)
- The client must:
  - Store the manifest locally
  - Run a **local update executor** that installs updates in the correct order
  - Emit a telemetry signal back to CentOps indicating update success/failure

## Example

```yaml
update_notification:
  method: polling
  endpoint: https://central.centops.io/api/v1/update/check
  token_type: environment_token
  frequency_seconds: 3600

update_manifest:
  url: https://central.centops.io/api/v1/update/manifest
  schema_version: v1
  includes:
    - component: telemetry-agent
      version: v2.3.0
      image: ghcr.io/org/centops-telemetry:v2.3.0
      sha256: a7c1f3...
    - component: pipeline-runner
      version: v1.9.2
      image: ghcr.io/org/centops-runner:v1.9.2
      sha256: 9bfa20...

update_execution:
  triggered_by: local_controller
  order: defined_by_manifest
  post_update_telemetry: true
```

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes**
- Ensures client-controlled execution of updates while maintaining centralized visibility
- Allows structured, signed manifests to be validated before applying updates
- Maintains compliance with outbound-only client communication models
- Standardizes update flows across all environments, reducing risk and drift

**Trade-offs**
- Adds implementation complexity on the client side (polling logic, update executor)
- Update success depends on client availability and local install logic
- Notification latency may delay urgent updates unless polling intervals are short
