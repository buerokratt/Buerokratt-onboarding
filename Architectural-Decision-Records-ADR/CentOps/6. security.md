# SEC-001: Secrets Management

## Context

CentOps components rely on various secrets to operate securely â€” including authentication tokens, service credentials, signing keys, and encrypted configuration values. These secrets must be managed in a way that is **secure, consistent, auditable, and environment-agnostic**.

Because CentOps is deployed across many client environments, the secret management model must support both **centralized** and **client-side** scenarios. Secrets must be injected into runtime environments securely and must never be embedded in code, images, or configuration files.

The architecture must also enforce **least privilege access**, so that each CentOps component can only access the secrets it strictly needs.

## Decision

- All CentOps secrets must be stored and accessed through a **dedicated secret management interface**
- Supported storage mechanisms:
  - **Kubernetes Secrets** for in-cluster CentOps components
  - **External vaults** (e.g. Vault by HashiCorp) where client policies or scale require it
- Secrets must **never** be:
  - Hardcoded in source code or Dockerfiles
  - Committed to Git repositories or config manifests
- Secrets must be:
  - Injected into containers at runtime (as environment variables or mounted files)
  - Encrypted at rest and in transit
  - Rotated periodically or on demand
- Each CentOps service must declare its required secrets explicitly
- Secret access must be enforced via:
  - Kubernetes RBAC
  - Vault access policies
  - Auditable access logs

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes**
- Centralizes and secures all secrets used across CentOps and client environments
- Enforces least-privilege access through per-service secret declarations
- Enables compliance with best practices for encryption, injection, and rotation
- Supports flexibility across Kubernetes-native and external vault-based deployments

**Trade-offs**
- Adds operational complexity for configuring and rotating secrets across environments
- Requires ongoing maintenance of access policies and audit pipelines
- May introduce compatibility constraints when integrating with client infrastructure that mandates a specific secret backend

# SEC-002: Internal Service Authentication and Token Strategy

## Context

CentOps consists of multiple decoupled services deployed across dynamic environments. These services include telemetry agents, discovery endpoints, delivery controllers, and central aggregators. To ensure secure communication and enforce isolation between environments, all **inter-service requests must be authenticated**.

A token-based authentication model is required to:
- Prevent unauthorized service access
- Enable auditability of service-level interactions
- Enforce multi-environment separation
- Support service-to-service identity without relying on infrastructure-specific solutions

The authentication mechanism must support both **centralized services** (e.g. aggregator) and **client-side agents** running in distributed environments.

## Decision

- All inter-service communication within CentOps must use **token-based authentication**
- Tokens may be:
  - **Static long-lived tokens** for bootstrapping or local agents in controlled environments
  - **Short-lived signed tokens** for central services and sensitive operations
- Token types:
  - **Service Tokens**: assigned to each CentOps service (e.g., telemetry agent, policy distributor)
  - **Environment Tokens**: scoped per client environment to enforce isolation
- All tokens must be:
  - Issued and rotated using a controlled process (e.g., GitHub Actions workflows, internal token signer)
  - Validated at the receiving service via standard JWT or HMAC mechanisms
  - Included via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` HTTP headers
- Tokens must be auditable and revocable without system restarts
- Central services must log:
  - Authenticated service ID
  - Source environment (if applicable)
  - Token expiration timestamp

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes**
- Secures all internal CentOps service communication using lightweight and standard-compliant methods
- Enables strict multi-environment isolation through token scoping
- Allows easy integration with GitHub Actions for token issuance and rotation
- Supports auditability and revocation through structured token metadata

**Trade-offs**
- Requires token validation logic to be embedded in every service
- Adds complexity around token lifecycle management and automated rotation
- Short-lived tokens introduce failure modes if not refreshed properly

# SEC-003: Communication Model Between CentOps and Client Environments

## Context

CentOps must operate across a dynamic and unbounded number of client environments. These environments are independently deployed and must maintain strict data boundaries. To support monitoring, delivery, discovery, and control flows, CentOps must establish a **secure, standardized communication model** between itself and each client instance.

This communication must be:
- Stateless, secure, and HTTP-based
- Compatible with firewalled or restricted environments
- Able to function across heterogeneous infrastructure
- Designed for **CentOps-initiated pull or client-initiated push**, depending on the use case

The model must ensure **multi-environment isolation**, observability, and robustness against transient failures or unreachable endpoints.

## Decision

- All communication between CentOps and client environments must occur over **HTTP(S)** using structured APIs or telemetry payloads
- Two supported models:
  - **Client-Initiated Push** (preferred): local CentOps agents push telemetry and state to central services
  - **CentOps-Initiated Pull**: CentOps polls discovery endpoints or verifies health as needed
- Communication endpoints must be:
  - Clearly versioned and documented (e.g. `/api/v1/telemetry/submit`)
  - Secured using environment-scoped **authentication tokens**
  - Capable of handling retries and exponential backoff
- All payloads must be structured and must not include:
  - Raw log data
  - PII or sensitive application-level payloads
- Clients must not be required to expose open inbound ports; all polling must be **outbound-initiated where possible**, or tunneled securely

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes**
- Enables reliable and secure communication across all client environments without requiring inbound port exposure
- Supports structured, auditable telemetry and control flows
- Maintains strong client data boundaries through token scopes and payload validation
- Works in diverse infrastructure scenarios with minimal assumptions

**Trade-offs**
- Requires coordination of two communication paths (push and pull), adding some complexity
- Environments with outbound restrictions may need proxying or relaying
- Push model may introduce short-lived blind spots if client connectivity is lost
