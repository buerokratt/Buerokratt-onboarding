# NOOPS-001: Deployment Pipelines

## Context

CentOps must operate across a broad range of client environments, each of which may have different technology stacks, runtime environments, deployment tools, and monitoring systems. To support scalability, modularity, and long-term maintainability, CentOps must be designed as a **technology-agnostic system**.

This means the core CentOps architecture must not depend on any specific programming language, infrastructure provider, or observability tool. Instead, all integrations and internal stages must rely on **declarative, interface-driven, and composable components** that expose clear boundaries between stages of the NoOps lifecycle.

While pipeline logic must be platform-neutral, the **execution of these pipelines is based on GitHub Actions**, and this will remain the default mechanism for orchestrating all stages. Additionally, **deployment and runtime execution of CentOps components must be based on Docker and Kubernetes** to ensure portability, resource isolation, and compatibility across environments.

## Decision

- All NoOps pipeline stages must be **technology-agnostic** and pluggable, defined by declarative input/output contracts.
- The pipeline execution engine will be **GitHub Actions**, used to orchestrate all stages including build, deploy, test, and observe.
- Runtime execution of CentOps components must be **containerized using Docker**.
- All orchestration, scaling, and environment lifecycle management must run on **Kubernetes**.
- CentOps must expose **extension points** to integrate with client-specific tools without modifying core pipeline logic.
- Internal orchestration must avoid tight coupling with tool-specific logic and must be driven by declarative metadata.

## Example

```yaml
pipeline:
  engine: github_actions
  stages:
    - name: build
      type: generic_runner
      config:
        input_artifact: source_code
        output_artifact: container_image
    - name: deploy
      type: container_deployer
      config:
        target: kubernetes
        strategy: rolling_update
    - name: verify
      type: probe_runner
      config:
        probes:
          - http_status
          - response_time
    - name: observe
      type: metrics_collector
      config:
        sources:
          - prometheus
          - local_summary

runtime:
  container_runtime: docker
  orchestrator: kubernetes
```

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes**
- Maintains a consistent and centralized orchestration model using GitHub Actions.
- Allows CentOps to remain technology-agnostic at the pipeline level while standardizing on Docker and Kubernetes for deployment.
- Encourages modular and declarative design, enabling future support for other pipeline engines if needed.
- Supports a scalable and portable deployment model across diverse environments.

**Trade-offs**
- Limits pipeline execution to GitHub Actions unless future adapters are developed.
- Requires containerization and Kubernetes familiarity for custom component development and deployment.
- Introduces some coordination complexity between declarative pipeline logic and GitHub Actions workflows.

# NOOPS-002: Delivery Rollback and Self-Healing Strategy

## Context

Failures during or after deployment are inevitable in distributed client environments. These failures may include regressions, service outages, or degraded performance. CentOps must minimize downtime and manual intervention by providing a **consistent strategy for automated rollback and self-healing** across all environments.

This strategy must be compatible with the existing delivery model based on Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions, and must work uniformly regardless of the specific application or client infrastructure.

## Decision

- All CentOps deployments must support **automated rollback** to the last known healthy state.
- Rollback must be triggered when predefined health checks or verification stages fail post-deployment.
- Health verification must be built into the pipeline as a dedicated, pluggable stage.
- Rollbacks must be executed using Kubernetes-native primitives (e.g. `kubectl rollout undo`, Helm revision rollback).
- In cases where rollback is not possible or fails, the system must surface alerts and fallback to safe degraded states when defined.
- Rollback and recovery actions must be fully observable and audit-logged through CentOps.

## Example

```yaml
deployment_policy:
  verify_after_deploy: true
  verification_timeout_seconds: 300
  rollback_on_failure: true
  rollback_method: helm
  health_checks:
    - type: http_status
      path: /health
      expected: 200
    - type: response_time
      threshold_ms: 500
  alert_on_unrecoverable: true
```

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes**
- Provides consistent delivery safety nets across all environments.
- Reduces operational burden by minimizing the need for manual intervention during failure scenarios.
- Improves trust in automation and accelerates deployment cycles with lower risk.
- Increases system resiliency by formalizing fallback behavior.

**Trade-offs**
- Adds latency to deployment completion due to post-deploy verification steps.
- Relies on accurate health check definitions; false positives may trigger unnecessary rollbacks.
- Requires environments to support Kubernetes-native rollback mechanisms.
