# ARCH-001: General Architectural Requirements

## Context

To support **scalability, adaptability, and long-term maintainability**, the CentOps architecture must follow a modular design. Each core function — including delivery orchestration, telemetry collection, environment discovery, and policy execution — must operate as an **independently deployable and observable service**.

All communication between services must occur via **HTTP-based APIs** to ensure compatibility with Kubernetes networking, GitHub Actions workflows, etc.

This approach guarantees:
- Clear functional boundaries across CentOps
- Independent development, testing, and deployment of components
- Consistent enforcement of security and data boundary policies
- Long-term flexibility to evolve or replace individual services

## Decision

### 1. Modular Functional Boundaries

- Core responsibilities must be implemented as **separate services**, including:
  - Delivery pipeline engine (GitHub Actions-driven)
  - Environment discovery and registration
  - Telemetry collector and aggregator
  - Configuration and policy distribution
- Components must be **functionally decoupled** and communicate only through documented interfaces
- Shared state between components must be externalized (e.g. via databases)

### 2. HTTP-Only API Integration

- All inter-service communication must use **HTTP REST APIs**
- All APIs must:
  - Be versioned (e.g., `/api/v1/`)
  - Return structured JSON responses and standardized error formats
  - Be discoverable and documented internally

### 3. Replaceability and Isolation

- Each component must be replaceable independently, provided it honors its interface contract
  - Example: the telemetry aggregator may be replaced without modifying environment discovery
- All business logic must remain encapsulated within the component that owns it
- Runtime behavior must be configured externally, not hardcoded

### 4. Docker and Kubernetes Deployment Constraint

- All CentOps services must:
  - Be deployed as Docker containers
  - Run in Kubernetes pods, isolated by function and role
- Components must avoid protocol features or behaviors incompatible with Kubernetes ingress controllers and Nginx-based routing (e.g., long-lived connections, non-HTTP framing)
- Metadata exchanged between components must be compatible with standard HTTP headers and Kubernetes-native service discovery

### 5. Environment and Runtime Separation

- Each service must run with its own security context and minimal permissions
- Cross-component access must be explicitly declared and auditable
- Scaling must be independently tunable per service based on workload

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes**
- Promotes clear architectural boundaries and isolated development tracks
- Ensures infrastructure compatibility with Docker, Kubernetes, and HTTP-only routing
- Simplifies observability, debugging, and pipeline transparency through REST-based interfaces
- Facilitates long-term flexibility by enabling component-level refactoring or replacement

**Trade-offs**
- Increases overhead for smaller or tightly coupled workflows
- Requires strict interface and versioning discipline to prevent integration drift
- Limits use of streaming or stateful protocols not easily expressed over HTTP
