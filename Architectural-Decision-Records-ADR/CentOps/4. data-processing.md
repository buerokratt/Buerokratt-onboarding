# DATA-001: Client Data Boundary Enforcement

## Context

CentOps must aggregate technical signals from an unbounded number of client environments. These environments operate independently and may contain sensitive business data, personally identifiable information, or confidential logs. However, CentOps must never collect or centralize **any** client-sensitive data.

Monitoring and telemetry must be designed to respect strict **data isolation boundaries**. While CentOps needs visibility into environment health and behavior, it must do so without accessing or transferring sensitive content such as raw logs, payloads, or client identifiers.

This ADR defines the architectural standard for **enforcing client data boundaries** across all telemetry, monitoring, and central aggregation mechanisms.

## Decision

- **No client-sensitive data** may be transferred from client environments to CentOps.
- Monitoring mechanisms must be designed to extract **only technical, non-sensitive metadata**, such as:
  - performance metrics (e.g., response times, throughput)
  - counts of specific log types (e.g., errors per minute)
  - component activity (e.g., service A is online)
- Logs must be **processed locally** within each client environment to generate summary statistics or patterns before sending any information centrally.
- All outbound telemetry from client environments must be passed through a **data boundary enforcement layer**, which ensures compliance with these rules.
- Any tooling or integration must be validated for **data leakage risks** prior to inclusion in CentOps.

## Example

```yaml
telemetry_policy:
  data_boundary_enforced: true
  outbound_filters:
    redact_log_content: true
    allow_metrics_only: true
  allowed_fields:
    - component_name
    - response_time_ms
    - error_rate
    - uptime_seconds
    - deployment_version
```

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes:**
- Ensures regulatory and contractual compliance for client privacy and data handling.
- Reduces legal and operational risk by strictly separating observability from client content.
- Supports scalable, trustable telemetry collection across many environments.
- Enables integration with enterprise clients that require strong data boundaries.

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires local log parsing and summarization infrastructure within each client environment.
- May limit depth of root-cause analysis unless additional context is explicitly modeled.
- Increases complexity of telemetry pipeline due to enforcement and validation layers.
