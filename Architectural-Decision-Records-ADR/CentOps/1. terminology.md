# TERM-001: Terminology - Redefining CI/CD as NoOps

## Context

The term "CI/CD" traditionally refers to Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment processes within a static set of environments. However, in this project, the scope extends far beyond automated builds and deployments. The CentOps system must support a fully autonomous delivery and monitoring pipeline across an unbounded and dynamic set of client environments. These environments change frequently and operate independently, yet must be observed and maintained centrally without violating data boundaries.

To reflect this broader scope and distinguish it from conventional CI/CD implementations, the term **"NoOps"** will be used consistently throughout the architecture and documentation. This positions the system as one that requires zero manual operations involvement across the entire lifecycle - development, delivery, and monitoring.

## Decision

- The term **"NoOps"** must be used instead of "CI/CD" across all architecture, documentation, user interfaces, and communications.
- "NoOps" must be defined as the automation of development, delivery, and environment monitoring across dynamic and distributed client systems.
- Any component that participates in the pipeline must support autonomous execution and be designed to minimize or eliminate the need for manual triggering or supervision.
- Documentation must clearly disambiguate NoOps from traditional CI/CD, especially when interfacing with external stakeholders or third-party tools.

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes**
- Clarifies the broader ambition of CentOps beyond conventional DevOps tooling.
- Supports architectural alignment around autonomy and multi-environment scalability.
- Prevents terminology confusion in internal and external communication.
- Enables separation of concerns when introducing new automation components or integration touchpoints.

**Trade-offs**
- Requires initial alignment effort with stakeholders accustomed to CI/CD terminology.
- May cause misunderstanding with vendors or tools that default to conventional DevOps language.
