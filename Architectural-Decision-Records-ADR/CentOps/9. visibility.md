# VIS-001: Operator-Facing GUI for Visibility and Diagnostics

## Context

CentOps is designed to operate autonomously across diverse environments with minimal manual intervention. However, in cases of deployment failure, configuration issues, telemetry anomalies, or degraded system health, operators must have clear, real-time visibility into the state of the system.

A **dedicated GUI** is required to expose the operational state of CentOps components and pipelines across environments. This GUI must present a unified view while respecting all client data boundaries.

To reduce maintenance overhead and align with ecosystem best practices, CentOps should favor **off-the-shelf GUI solutions** (e.g. Prometheus, Kubernetes Dashboards) where available, rather than building new interfaces unnecessarily.

## Decision

- CentOps must provide one or more **operator-facing GUIs** to expose runtime state, diagnostics, and telemetry across environments.
- The GUI(s) must be:
  - **Read-only** by default, with optional scoped controls (e.g., rollback trigger) where access is explicitly granted
  - **Multi-environment aware**, presenting CentOps data across all clients in a logically separated, safe manner
  - Focused on **metadata and operational summaries**, not raw log data or client-sensitive content
- Where off-the-shelf GUI solutions are available and applicable (e.g., Prometheus UI, Grafana dashboards):
  - They **must be reused** rather than rebuilt
  - Custom GUIs must only be developed where necessary functionality is not available or cannot be integrated
- A **central index page or document** must be maintained that lists:
  - All GUI entry points (URLs or access paths)
  - Their purpose and supported features
  - Authentication or RBAC notes if applicable
- All GUIs must be accessible through secure, authenticated sessions, with environment-scoped access rights enforced.

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes**
- Reduces development overhead by leveraging mature, proven GUI solutions already used in the ecosystem.
- Ensures operators have quick, consistent visibility across all CentOps environments.
- Supports fast onboarding for teams already familiar with standard tools (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.).
- Keeps GUI sprawl manageable by requiring a single, documented entry point for all visual tools.

**Trade-offs**
- Introduces dependency on external tools and their release cycles or security models.
- GUI integration must be maintained in sync with back-end component changes.
- May require adapting CentOps telemetry or metadata to fit existing visualization schemas.

# VIS-002: Client Environment Discovery and Management

## Context

CentOps must support an unknown and continuously evolving number of client environments. These environments may be added, removed, or reconfigured at any time. A static list of environments is insufficient; instead, the system must implement dynamic discovery and environment lifecycle awareness.

Each client runs an instance of CentOps that includes its own local discovery capabilities. Since CentOps controls this layer, discovery behavior is consistent across all environments regardless of underlying infrastructure or configuration differences.

CentOps must maintain accurate and up-to-date knowledge of:
- which environments are active
- which components are deployed within them
- how and when they change over time

This must be achieved without collecting sensitive infrastructure metadata or relying on manual registration.

## Decision

- All client environments will run a local CentOps agent that includes a **self-describing discovery endpoint** to surface operational state and active components.
- CentOps will initiate discovery via **secure polling** or optional hooks, depending on its internal configuration.
- A centralized CentOps registry will maintain an aggregated view of **all known environments**, continuously updated from local sources.
- The discovery metadata must contain only **non-sensitive operational fields**, including component names, versions, deployment regions, and health flags.
- No manual configuration of environments will be required, as the discovery functionality is standardized and bundled with each CentOps deployment.

## Example

```yaml
environment_discovery:
  enabled: true
  discovery_strategy: pull
  poll_interval_seconds: 60
  endpoint: http://localhost:9000/.well-known/centops/env.json
  expected_fields:
    - environment_id
    - region
    - active_components
    - version
    - health_status
```

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes**
- Ensures consistent discovery across all clients by embedding logic within CentOps itself.
- Enables CentOps to scale automatically as environments are added or changed.
- Eliminates the need for client-specific onboarding or configuration.
- Supports accurate routing of monitoring and automation actions based on up-to-date operational context.

**Trade-offs**
- Adds responsibility to CentOps to maintain the reliability and correctness of its own discovery subsystem.
- Any bug or misconfiguration in the discovery layer will propagate to the centralized registry.
- Requires coordination between local and central CentOps instances for state reconciliation and availability fallback.

# VIS-002: Observability Contracts for CentOps Components

## Context

CentOps operates its own distributed components across many client environments, including agents, orchestrators, telemetry collectors, deployment runners, and other pipeline utilities. These CentOps-managed services must remain observable at all times for operational reliability and debugging purposes.

To ensure consistent, scalable monitoring, each CentOps component must implement a **default observability contract** that defines the minimum telemetry signals it must expose. This contract does not apply to the client applications that CentOps manages or deploys — it applies only to **CentOps' own infrastructure and tooling**.

## Decision

- All CentOps-owned components must implement a **default observability contract** that includes:
  - a defined set of required metrics
  - a method for exposing those metrics (e.g., HTTP or push-based)
  - embedded metadata for environment identification
- Required metrics must include:
  - uptime
  - component version
  - health status
  - request count
  - error count
  - response time (p95)
- Metrics must be exposed via:
  - a Prometheus-compatible `/metrics` endpoint (preferred), or
  - a push-compatible format defined by CentOps' telemetry schema
- Observability compliance must be validated both at component startup and during pipeline execution.
- Client applications deployed or managed by CentOps are **not required** to follow this contract.

## Example

```yaml
observability_contract:
  applies_to: centops_components_only
  metrics_endpoint: /metrics
  format: prometheus
  required_metrics:
    - uptime_seconds
    - version
    - health_status
    - request_count
    - error_count
    - response_time_p95
  metadata:
    environment_id: required
    component_id: required
    schema_version: v1
  verification:
    validate_on_startup: true
    validate_in_pipeline: true
```

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes**
- Guarantees operational visibility for all CentOps infrastructure across clients.
- Enables consistent telemetry and alerting without one-off instrumentation.
- Reduces debugging time by standardizing available metrics.
- Ensures clear separation between CentOps observability and client application monitoring.

**Trade-offs**
- Adds implementation overhead to lightweight CentOps utilities.
- May result in some unused metrics in components with narrow scope.
- Requires enforcement logic to validate contract compliance across all deployments.
