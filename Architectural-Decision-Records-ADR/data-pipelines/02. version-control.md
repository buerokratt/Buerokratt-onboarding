# VC-001: Unified Version Control System

## Context

To ensure **consistency, traceability, and reproducibility** across all development and deployment workflows, a **structured version control strategy** must be enforced. This guarantees **auditability, rollback capabilities, and collaboration efficiency**.

## Decision

1. **Centralized Version Control for Code & Pipelines**
   - All source code, configuration files, and automation scripts must be stored in **a centralized version control system (e.g., Git-based repositories)**.
   - The system must support **branching strategies** to manage feature development, testing, and production releases.
   - CI/CD pipelines must be defined as **version-controlled code (Infrastructure as Code - IaC)**.

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**
- **Code Integrity** – Ensures controlled, versioned changes for development and deployment.
- **Collaboration Efficiency** – Enables multiple teams to work on different features in parallel.
- **Rollback & Recovery** – Provides historical tracking and restoration of previous states.

### **Potential Trade-offs**
- **Merge Complexity** – Requires well-defined branching policies to avoid conflicts.
- **Storage & Performance Overhead** – Large repositories can slow down development workflows.

# VC-002: Data & Model Versioning

## Context

To enable **reproducibility and auditability** in NLP pipelines, all **datasets, processed outputs, and trained models** must be version-controlled.

## Decision

1. **Versioning for Data & Model Artifacts**
   - All datasets, processed data versions, and trained models must follow **semantic versioning** (e.g., `1.0.0` for major updates, `1.0.1` for minor changes).
   - Data pipelines must track **input/output versions**, ensuring reproducibility of NLP processing.
   - Example solutions include **DVC (Data Version Control) or cloud-based versioning (S3 versioning, MLflow for model tracking)**.

## Example

### Use (Semantic Versioning for Data Artifacts)
```json
{
  "dataset": "nlp_corpus",
  "version": "2.1.3",
  "source": "s3://data-pipeline/corpus-v2.1.3",
  "hash": "sha256:abc1234567890...",
  "created_at": "2024-03-10T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Forbidden (Unversioned, Untracked Changes)
```bash
mv dataset.csv dataset_new.csv  # No version tracking
```

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**
- **Reproducibility** – Ensures exact replication of past experiments and pipeline runs.
- **Traceability** – Enables detailed tracking of data, models, and source code changes.

### **Potential Trade-offs**
- **Storage Overhead** – Retaining multiple versions may increase costs.
- **Version Complexity** – Requires policies for tagging, branching, and lifecycle management.

# VC-003: Reproducibility & Auditability

## Context

To guarantee **consistent results and full traceability**, every commit, pipeline execution, and data transformation must be **linked to a specific version**.

## Decision

1. **Full Traceability Across Workflows**
   - Every code commit, pipeline execution, and data transformation must be **traceable via unique version IDs**.
   - Execution logs must store **the exact version of scripts, models, and input data used**.
   - Changes must be **documented via commit messages, changelogs, and versioned release notes**.

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**
- **Auditability** – Ensures that every workflow execution can be traced back to its exact configuration.
- **Regulatory Compliance** – Supports accountability in environments requiring data lineage.

### **Potential Trade-offs**
- **Log Management Overhead** – Requires efficient logging strategies to avoid excessive storage usage.
- **Operational Complexity** – Needs structured processes to enforce full traceability.

# VC-004: Automated Versioning in CI/CD Pipelines

## Context

To streamline **deployment, tracking, and rollback capabilities**, CI/CD pipelines must handle **automated versioning** for all artifacts.

## Decision

1. **Automated Versioning for Pipelines & Artifacts**
   - Pipeline runs must automatically **tag artifacts with version numbers**, ensuring each deployment references a specific state.
   - Model retraining jobs must log **the dataset version, model hyperparameters, and training configuration**.
   - Rollback strategies must allow **reverting to previous working versions of code, pipelines, or data**.

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**
- **Faster Deployment Processes** – Automates artifact tracking across different environments.
- **Safer Rollbacks** – Prevents deployments from being blocked by unversioned dependencies.

### **Potential Trade-offs**
- **Pipeline Complexity** – Requires structured tagging mechanisms to avoid inconsistencies.
- **Versioning Conflicts** – Automated versioning may require additional validation steps.

# VC-005: Access Control & Governance

## Context

To ensure **secure and structured access** to versioned resources, **role-based access control (RBAC) and compliance policies** must be enforced.

## Decision

1. **Enforced Access Control for Versioned Resources**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) must enforce **restricted write permissions** to production branches.
   - Data versioning must ensure **compliance with regulatory and security requirements**.
   - Version histories must be **retained for an appropriate period based on compliance guidelines**.

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**
- **Security & Compliance** – Prevents unauthorized changes to critical assets.
- **Audit-Ready Environment** – Ensures controlled access with full modification history.

### **Potential Trade-offs**
- **Administrative Overhead** – Requires ongoing management of access roles and policies.
- **Access Delays** – Strict permissioning may slow down feature development workflows.
