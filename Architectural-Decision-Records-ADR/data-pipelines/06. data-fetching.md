# FETCH-001: Data Acquisition Strategy

## Context

To ensure **scalable, compliant, and modular** data collection, a **structured acquisition strategy** must be enforced. Data sources may include **structured APIs, databases, web scraping, and document parsing**. A machine-readable, well-defined strategy must dictate **fetching intervals, update cycles, data retention policies, and source prioritization**.

## Decision

1. **Standardized Data Collection Methods**
   - Data ingestion must support **structured (APIs, databases) and unstructured (scraping, document parsing) sources**.
   - Data extraction processes must be **modular and interchangeable**.
   - Versioning and tracking mechanisms must be applied to all collected data.

2. **Compliance & Legal Considerations**
   - Data acquisition must comply with **legal, ethical, and technical constraints** (e.g., **robots.txt compliance, API terms of service**).
   - Rate limiting and respectful crawling strategies must be enforced to prevent service disruption.

3. **Scalability & Performance Optimization**
   - Parallelized processing and asynchronous fetching must be **supported where applicable**.
   - Caching strategies should be employed to avoid redundant data requests.

4. **Machine-Understandable Data Acquisition Strategy**
   - A structured acquisition strategy must define:
     - **Fetching intervals**: How often data should be retrieved (e.g., real-time, hourly, daily, weekly).
     - **Source prioritization**: Rules for preferring certain sources over others.
     - **Data retention policies**: Expiry and storage requirements per dataset.
     - **Processing priority**: Determining which datasets require immediate processing vs. scheduled updates.
     - **Source registry integration**: Each fetching operation must reference a predefined source registry (covered in **FETCH-006**).

## Example

### Use (Structured Strategy for Data Acquisition)
```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "type": "API",
      "source": "internal_source_registry.api_sources",
      "fetch_interval": "hourly",
      "priority": "high",
      "retention_period": "90 days"
    },
    {
      "type": "web_scraping",
      "source": "internal_source_registry.web_sources",
      "fetch_interval": "daily",
      "priority": "medium",
      "robots_txt_compliance": true
    },
    {
      "type": "document_processing",
      "source": "internal_source_registry.document_sources",
      "fetch_interval": "weekly",
      "priority": "low",
      "storage_policy": "archive_after_processing"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Forbidden (Unstructured, Uncontrolled Data Acquisition)
```bash
wget https://example.com/data  # No scheduling, priority, or retention defined
```

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**
- **Interoperability** – Allows seamless integration with multiple data sources.
- **Scalability** – Supports high-volume data collection without performance degradation.
- **Legal & Ethical Compliance** – Reduces risk of violations when scraping or accessing third-party services.

# FETCH-002: Source Registry Management

## Context

To ensure **consistent and structured data acquisition**, all sources must be managed within a **centralized source registry**. This enables **controlled access, auditing, and retrieval of data sources**.

## Decision

1. **Centralized Source Management**
   - All data sources (APIs, web scraping targets, document repositories) must be stored in a **predefined, structured registry**.
   - Source registry entries must include **metadata, prioritization rules, and update cycles**.

2. **Standardized Source Definitions**
   - Sources must be defined in **machine-readable formats** (e.g., JSON, YAML).
   - Example attributes:
     - **Source type**: API, web scraping, document processing.
     - **Access method**: OAuth, API key, direct URL, file storage path.
     - **Fetching priority**: High, medium, low.
     - **Retention policy**: Days before data is archived or deleted.

## Example

### Use (Machine-Readable Source Registry)
```json
{
  "api_sources": [
    {
      "name": "OpenWeather API",
      "endpoint": "https://api.openweathermap.org/data",

## Decision

1. **Validation Rules & Schema Enforcement**
   - All collected data must conform to **predefined schemas (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV format validation)**.
   - Schema definitions must be **version-controlled** to track changes.
   - Example validation frameworks include **Pydantic (Python), JSON Schema, and Great Expectations**.

2. **Automatic Detection of Schema & Structure Changes**
   - API response structure changes must trigger **automated alerts**.
   - Web scraping tools must detect **HTML structure changes** and notify data fetchers.
   - Document metadata (headers, tables, formatting) must be validated for consistency.

3. **Handling Missing & Corrupt Data**
   - **Deduplication mechanisms** must be applied to prevent redundant entries.
   - **Anomaly detection techniques** should flag incomplete or inconsistent data.
   - Data transformations must be **logged and reversible**.

## Example

### Use (Schema Change Detection in API Response)
```json
{
  "source": "Financial Market API",
  "detected_change": {
    "previous_schema": {
      "price": "float",
      "timestamp": "ISO8601"
    },
    "new_schema": {
      "price": "string",
      "timestamp": "ISO8601"
    },
    "alert": "Field 'price' changed type from float to string"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-03-10T14:00:00Z"
}
```

### Use (HTML Structure Change Detection in Web Scraping)
```json
