# Data Fetching Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Purpose

This repository documents **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** related to **data fetching, processing, and integration** with external, third-party, and custom-made tools. The objective is to establish a **scalable, modular, and adaptable** system for handling text-based data sources.

## Scope

These ADRs define **best practices and requirements** for
- **Standardized data exchange formats** to ensure structured and unstructured data compatibility.
- **Schema versioning** to maintain backward compatibility and prevent format mismatches.
- **Allowed file formats and configurable processing endpoints** for flexibility.
- **Configurable text encoding** to enable adaptation to different system requirements.
- **Workflow orchestration and automation** for reliable data processing and ingestion.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## NLP in ADRs
> The term **NLP** within ADRs does **not exclusively** refer to Machine Learning-based Natural Language Processing. Instead, it includes all aspects of text-based data handling, such as
> - **Data fetching** (scraping, API ingestion, file extraction).
> - **Pre-processing** (tokenization, normalization, metadata enrichment).
> - **Format standardization** to ensure consistency across external integrations.
>
> This definition ensures that all **text-based workflows** are covered, even if they do not involve ML models.

## Design Principles

- **Interoperability** – The system must integrate seamlessly with external tools and platforms.
- **Modularity** – Components must be replaceable without major architectural changes.
- **Configurability** – Encoding, file formats, and processing workflows must be adaptable.
- **Backward Compatibility** – Schema and format changes must not break existing workflows.
- **Automation** – Data processing pipelines should minimize manual intervention.

## Why Is This Important

**Ensures compatibility** across different tools and services.  
**Reduces complexity** by enforcing standardization.  
**Future-proofs the system** with adaptable, versioned architecture.  
**Minimizes disruptions** by ensuring stability for upstream and downstream integrations.
