# LOG-001: Structured Logging for NLP Pipelines

## Context

To ensure **visibility, debugging capabilities, and operational insights**, the system must implement **structured logging** for NLP workflows. Logs must be **structured, standardized, and centrally stored** to support tracking, analysis, and optimization.

## Decision

1. **Structured Logging Format**
   - All NLP-related processes must **emit structured logs** for tracking system behavior.
   - Logs must be stored in **centralized logging systems** to ensure aggregation and querying.
   - Example formats: **JSON-based structured logs including NLP-specific metadata (e.g., token count, processing errors).**

2. **Unified Log Schema for NLP Pipelines**
   - A **common NLP logging schema** must be defined to standardize log formats across different workflows.
   - Each log entry must include:
     - **Timestamp**
     - **Workflow name & task ID**
     - **Processing status (success, failure, retry, etc.)**
     - **Performance metrics (execution time, token count, errors encountered)**
     - **Optional metadata (e.g., source document ID, processing parameters used)**

3. **Log Export & Retention Policies**
   - Logs must be **exportable in standard formats** such as JSON or structured CSV.
   - The system must support **configurable log retention policies** to balance **storage costs and long-term analysis needs**.

## Example

### Use (Structured Logging for NLP Workflow Execution)
```json
{
  "workflow": "nlp_text_processing",
  "task": "extract_entities",
  "status": "failed",
  "error": "Timeout while connecting to NER model",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T14:15:00Z",
  "metrics": {
    "tokens_processed": 300,
    "response_time": "2.5s"
  }
}
```

### Forbidden (Unstructured Logging Without Centralization)
```bash
echo "Something went wrong in task extract_entities" >> logfile.log
```

## Consequences

### **Positive Outcomes**
- **Standardization** – A unified logging schema ensures consistency across all text processing workflows.
- **Faster Debugging** – Structured logs facilitate quick identification of failure points.
- **Performance Optimization** – NLP processing efficiency can be analyzed and improved.

### **Potential Trade-offs**
- **Log Storage Overhead** – Storing logs for large-scale workflows may require retention policies.
- **Compliance Considerations** – Log retention policies must balance analytical needs and data protection requirements.
- **Resource Costs** – Real-time tracking tools may require additional computational resources.
